# _travis-esp32_

This is a companion repository for [travis](https://github.com/carpit680/travis.git), an unmanned indoor rover project.

The code is meant to be used on an Espressif esp32 S3 dev board.
It provides a differential drive controller with a PID control loop using quadrature encoders for feedback and controlling wheel velocities using PWM out.
